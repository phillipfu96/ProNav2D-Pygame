# Proportional Navigation Program
This program demonstrates the concept of [Proportional Navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_navigation), a guidance technique used in missile guidance and other tracking systems. The PN algorithm adjusts the velocity of an object to intercept a moving target by maintaining a constant rate of change of the line of sight (LOS) angle.
